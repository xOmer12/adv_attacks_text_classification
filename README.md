# What Next
1. Need new attacks (PGD etc.).
2. Fix projection in advrunner.py (project function with PP^T).
3. Add other metrics like HW1 (for now we have only clean/perturbed accuracy)
4. Plots and graphs (Preferably in a notebook after getting results)
5. If there is time, new task - and check transferability. We probably need this.
6. More?
7. Add requirements.txt
